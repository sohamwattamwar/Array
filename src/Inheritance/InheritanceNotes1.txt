Types
1) Single Inheritance
2) Multilevel Inheritance
3) Hierarchy Inheritance
4) Hybrid Inheritance
5) Multiple Inheritance   => Java 8



1 Parent => 1 Child   (Single)
  (10 Acre)           (5 + 10acre)   (15)      (2)      (17)
GreatGrandParent  => GrandParent => Father => Child => Grand Child  (Multilevel)

 (10 methods)   =>
1 Parent => More than 1 Children(Hierarchy)



More than 1 Parent => Single Child  (Multiple) => Java Does not support


class Parent1{

		void test(){
			System.out.println("Parent1 class Test Method");
		}

}

class Parent2{

		void test(){
			System.out.println("Parent2 class Test Method");
		}

}

class Child extends Parent1, Parent2{


	psvm(){
		Child child = new Child();
		child.test();

	}

}
//Multiple inheritance causes Ambiguity i.e. which Parent class method I need to call
// and that is why Java does not support Multiple inheritance
