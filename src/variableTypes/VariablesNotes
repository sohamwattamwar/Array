for static variable it will take last updated value or last value provided
by object will be applied for static variable
BUT,if if we create 2 objects before printing statement and the use printing statement
    for static variable value provided by second obj will be applied

BUT IN CASE ==> we have created third obj after printing statement then
                value for first two statement will be different
                and for third statement is different because java executes code line by line
e.g===>
for static variable

obj.a=1;
obj1.a=2;

sout will for a using obj==2;  //value changed
sout will for a using obj1==2;
then we againg provide value

obj2.a=3;
sout will for a using obj2==3;
