Methods
=> We can create multiple methods in single java class
=> We can not create methods with duplicate name and parameter list in same class.
=> When we use void as return type for a method then writing return statement in method is optional.
=> When we don't use void as return type for a method then writing return statement in method is must.
=> you can use any primitive data type as a returntype for a method if you don't want to use void as returntype.


Objects:
=> We use Objects to access variables and methods inside the class.
